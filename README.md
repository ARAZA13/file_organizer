### File Organizer and Analyzer

This Python program organizes files in the user's "Downloads" directory and provides analysis on the types of files found. It consists of the following steps:

1. **Get Directory Path**: It gets the path to the user's "Downloads" directory.

2. **Print Directory Path**: Displays the "Downloads" directory path.

3. **Create File Data Table**: Gathers information about files in the directory, including file name, type, and date added.

4. **Create "DD" Directory**: Creates a new "DD" directory inside the "Downloads" directory.

5. **Organize and Copy Files**: Sorts files into subfolders based on their file types (extensions) and moves files without extensions to a "missing" folder within "DD."

6. **Save Data as CSV**: Saves file information in a CSV file within the "DD" directory.

7. **Plot and Save Bar Graph**: Generates a bar graph showing the number of files by file type, including a category for files with missing types. The graph is saved as an image in the "DD" directory.

The program is designed to help Macbook users maintain a cleaner Downloads directory and gain insights into the types of files they frequently download.
